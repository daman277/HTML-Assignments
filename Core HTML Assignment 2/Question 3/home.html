<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>I'm Er. Damanjot Singh, an Electrical Engineer 
with a passion for designing and optimizing electrical
systems. Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to
ensuring the efficient and safe distribution of 
electricity. Now, I'm eager to explore new horizons 
and challenges in the ever-evolving world of electrical
 engineering. I've been very curious about the working
 of websites, that's why I'm currently trying to upskill myself in 
Web Development.</p>
