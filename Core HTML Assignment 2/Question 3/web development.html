 <h1>INTRODUCTION ABOUT WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1> 
 <p>Web development is like building and designing
     stuff on the internet. It's how websites and 
     online tools are created. Think of it as a mix of 
     creativity and computer skills. Web developers make 
     things look good on the screen (the part you see) and 
     work behind the scenes (the part you don't see) to make
    sure everything runs smoothly. It's an exciting field
    where people make cool things happen online!</p>
