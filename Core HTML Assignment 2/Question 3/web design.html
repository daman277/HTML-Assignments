<h1>INTRODUCTION ABOUT WEB DESIGN</h1>
<P>Web design is like decorating a digital house. It's all about 
making websites look pretty and easy to use. Web designers choose
colors, fonts, and pictures to create a great online experience for you.
They're the ones who make sure everything on a website is in the right
place and easy to click. So, when you visit a website and find it
attractive and easy to navigate, that's the magic of web design at work!</P>
